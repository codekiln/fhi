  <p>We’re looking for proven ideas that have the potential to do great things for the U.S. health care delivery system.  It is widely known that health care innovations are much slower to disseminate than comparable solutions in other industries.  We want to help speed up the process.  What’s your innovation?</p>
<p>Innovations must have credible, demonstrated evidence of their value proposition (such as cost savings, outcomes improvement, patient satisfaction, etc.); have a compelling dissemination plan; and be at the cusp of scaling. You can <a href="http://openforum.hbs.org/challenge/hbs-hms-health-acceleration-challenge/innovations/">Apply Now</a> or find out more through our <a href="#challenge-faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</a>. </p>
<p>We will hold an informational webinar on 
September 17, 2014 at 12:00 PM ET. Please register for the webinar here: </p>

  <p>Our Health Acceleration Challenge finalists will gain access to 150 senior health care leaders at our invitation-only conference in April 2015. At our previous conference, over 50% of attendees were CEOs or presidents. Finalists will discuss their scale-up plans in a discussion led by senior Harvard faculty. There also will be an opportunity for one-on-one discussions with health care leaders at networking events. Our keynote speakers for this year&#39;s conference include <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aetna.com/about-us/aetna-leadership.html">Mark T. Bertolini, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President, Aetna Inc.</a>; <a target="_blank" href="http://hms.harvard.edu/about-hms/deans-corner">Jeffrey S.

    <h1 class="docs-heading">Criteria<span class="anchor-target" id="challenge-criteria"></span>
<a href="#challenge-criteria" name="challenge-criteria" class="anchor glyphicon glyphicon-link"></a></h1>
  </div>
  
  <p>Judging will be based on: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Impact —</strong> We will evaluate applications on their potential to improve the value of the U.S. health care delivery system by lowering cost, improving quality, and/or improving access. We are looking for tested innovations that, if more broadly disseminated, would dramatically improve health care value.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Evidence —</strong> We ask for credible information from existing sites, pilots or customers that your innovation works. The more evidence you can provide, the stronger your application.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dissemination —</strong> We want to know about your scale-up plan. What other sites, partners or customers do you intend to engage or have you already lined up? How will you overcome the common barriers to adoption? What’s the timeline? Your innovation does not necessarily have to be in commercializable form, but you need a solid dissemination plan.</p>
</li>

<li><h4 id="what-is-the-forum-on-health-care-innovation-">What is the Forum on Health Care Innovation?</h4>
<p> The Forum on Health Care Innovation is collaboration between <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/healthcare">Harvard Business School</a> (HBS) and <a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a> (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry. </p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-is-the-health-acceleration-challenge-">What is the Health Acceleration Challenge?</h4>
<p> Our Challenge aims to identify and promote innovations that have credible, demonstrated evidence to generate significant value for the U.S. health care delivery system. In particular, we are looking for proven ideas that, if more broadly disseminated, could move the needle on cost, quality or access.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-do-you-mean-by-demonstrated-value-and-potential-to-scale-rapidly-">What do you mean by &quot;demonstrated value&quot; and &quot;potential to scale rapidly&quot;?</h4>
<p> We want to see credible evidence from existing sites, pilots or customers that your innovation works. The more evidence you can provide, the stronger your application. Your innovation does not necessarily have to be in final product form for commercialization, but you need to provide a solid dissemination plan of how you will overcome barriers to adoption across the US.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-are-examples-of-credible-evidence-">What are examples of &quot;credible evidence&quot;?</h4>
<p> You determine what your best evidence is. It could be quantitative data from existing pilots showing improved patient outcomes, customer satisfaction data, cost savings documentation, or anything else that demonstrates success.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="are-participants-supposed-to-solve-a-specific-problem-">Are participants supposed to solve a specific problem?</h4>
<p> Innovation and value creation for health care delivery can come in many shapes and sizes from process improvement and new business models to software or hardware innovations. As a result, we want you to tell us how your innovation has created value for patients, customers or the delivery system and why your idea will be able to transform U.S. health care delivery.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-participating-">What are the benefits of participating?</h4>
<p> If you are a finalist, your innovation will be discussed at our invitation-only conference in April 2015 during a case discussion led by senior Harvard faculty. You will have the opportunity to meet with potential customers, investors and partners at the conference dinner. Finalists will also benefit from feedback from our community of health care leaders and entrepreneurs, announcements to over 150,000 HBS and HMS alumni, and up to $200,000.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="how-do-teams-apply-">How do teams apply?</h4>
<p> Please submit your application <a href="http://openforum.hbs.org/challenge/hbs-hms-health-acceleration-challenge/innovations/">here</a>. Applications close on <strong>September 29, 2014 at 11:59 PM ET</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="how-is-this-different-from-other-challenges-">How is this different from other Challenges?</h4>
<p> We believe innovations need to spread faster. We are focused on speeding up the adoption of innovations that have already demonstrated value and could benefit from wider dissemination through the powerful combination of the participants in the Forum on Health Care Innovation and the Harvard faculty and alumni network. We are not a business plan competition. </p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="who-should-apply-to-the-health-acceleration-challenge-">Who should apply to the Health Acceleration Challenge?</h4>
<p> We welcome applications from all types of people—individuals and teams, clinicians and administrators, technologists and scientists, and those in the health care industry or outside of it—anyone with a proven health care innovation.   All types of organizations are invited to apply as well—established or early stage, for profit or not for profit, from within the U.S. or outside.  </p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-for-profit-entity-">Do I have to be a for-profit entity?</h4>
<p> No. For-profit and non-profit ideas are bothwelcomed for consideration.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="do-i-have-to-be-based-in-the-u-s-or-boston-">Do I have to be based in the U.S. or Boston?</h4>
<p> No, you can be based anywhere in the world but your solution needs to be applicable to the U.S. health care delivery system and you need to have a credible plan on how to deliver your solution in the U.S. market.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-are-you-not-looking-for-">What are you not looking for?</h4>
<p> Pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device, and diagnostic technologies may not be the best fit for this challenge unless they have demonstrated impact on improving care delivery processes beyond typical product interventions.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="how-far-along-does-my-innovation-have-to-be-">How far along does my innovation have to be?</h4>
<p> The application is open to any organization or solution ranging from nearly developed to fully developed to the early stages of deployment. However, you need credible demonstrated evidence that your solution can significantly impact the U.S. health care delivery system.  This means your solution needs to be implemented in at least one setting.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-criteria-will-the-judging-committee-use-">What criteria will the Judging Committee use?</h4>
<p> Our judging panel will evaluate applications based on <a href="#challenge-criteria">criteria</a> including impact and value creation potential, credible evidence of idea, dissemination plan, and other participants&#39; comments.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="i-am-not-a-harvard-alumnus-can-i-still-apply-">I am not a Harvard alumnus, can I still apply?</h4>
<p> Absolutely! Anyone can participate in the Health Acceleration Challenge.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="i-want-to-participate-but-don-t-have-an-innovation-how-much-time-and-effort-does-it-take-to-be-a-part-of-a-challenge-">I want to participate but don&#39;t have an innovation. How much time and effort does it take to be a part of a challenge?</h4>
<p> Participants can contribute on a variety of levels, ranging from applauding ideas to contributing complex concepts. Being a part of our Challenge requires anywhere from a few minutes to many hours. It&#39;s totally up to you! Sharing insightful comments on other people&#39;s ideas on the Health Acceleration Challenge platform <strong>could earn you free tickets to our invite-only Conference</strong> even if you are not a Challenge applicant.</p>
</li>
<li><h4 id="what-happens-to-my-intellectual-property-on-the-health-acceleration-challenge-platform-">What happens to my intellectual property on the Health Acceleration Challenge platform?</h4>
<p> Our application does not ask for detailed IP information and there is no reason you have to disclose this to anyone on the platform if you are not comfortable doing so. Irrespectively, each user owns the copyright to any submission made on our platform.</p>
